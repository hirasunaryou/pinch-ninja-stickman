# Lessons / ミッション集
Beginner-friendly goals you can try while playing. Feel free to invent your own!

| Mission | Difficulty | Combo target | Rank idea | Screenshot idea | Effects to notice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Warmup: Hit 3 targets | ★☆☆ | No combo needed | Rank C | Take a shot when you see “Score: 30” | Watch how the slash arc follows your pinch. |
| Speed boost: 5 hits in 15s | ★★☆ | Chain 2 hits back-to-back | Rank B | Capture the timer around “15s” | Faster pinches keep the slash active longer. |
| Precision: Hit small circles | ★★☆ | Maintain pinch for smooth swings | Rank B | Zoom in on a single tiny target | Lower `TARGET_RADIUS` in `EDIT HERE` to practice accuracy. |
| Marathon: Reach 150 points | ★★★ | Make 3-hit streaks | Rank A | End-of-round screen with final score | Notice how missing time stops target movement. |
| Chaos mode: Many fast targets | ★★★ | Any combo you can | Rank S | Full screen with targets everywhere | Increase `TARGET_COUNT` and `TARGET_SPEED_RANGE` for chaos. |

Tips:
- Pinch gently—too much movement can break the pinch detection.
- If targets feel slow, raise `TARGET_SPEED_RANGE`. If it’s too hard, lower `TARGET_COUNT`.
- Share your own missions with friends and compare screenshots!
